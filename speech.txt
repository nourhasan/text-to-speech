Lecturer:
Good morning, everyone. Today’s lecture focuses on urban farming, a practice that has gained popularity in cities around the world. Urban farming involves growing food within city limits, often in community gardens, rooftops, or unused spaces.
One major benefit is that it helps reduce the carbon footprint by lowering the need to transport food long distances. It also improves food security in low-income neighborhoods.
Another important point is the sense of community involvement. Many urban gardens are run by volunteers, encouraging teamwork and healthy eating.
However, challenges remain. A major issue is limited space, which can restrict what crops are grown. In addition, soil quality in cities can be poor or even contaminated.
To solve this, some farms use raised beds or hydroponic systems. These methods don’t require traditional soil and can be used in smaller areas.
Urban farming also provides educational opportunities. Schools often use it to teach children about nutrition and the environment.
Studies show that exposure to green spaces can even reduce stress and promote well-being among city residents.
